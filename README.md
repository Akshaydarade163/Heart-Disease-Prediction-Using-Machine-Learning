### Abstract: 
Heart disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with modern lifestyles significantly contributing to its prevalence. Accurate identification of heart disease is a critical yet complex task that requires precision and expertise. However, not all healthcare providers have access to specialists or advanced diagnostic tools. An automated system for heart disease prediction can enhance healthcare quality, increase accessibility, and reduce costs.
In this project, we have developed a machine learning-based system to efficiently predict heart disease risk levels based on health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and age. The system uses advanced algorithms to discover predictive patterns and generate interpretable rules that can be customized to prioritize based on user needs. The model's performance has been evaluated through metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, demonstrating its potential for accurate and reliable heart disease prediction.
This project emphasizes the integration of technology in healthcare to improve diagnostic accuracy and enable timely interventions, especially in areas with limited access to specialists.

### Feature:
Age is a significant factor, as the likelihood of heart disease typically increases with age.
Sex helps account for biological differences, with males often at higher risk compared to females.
Chest pain type (cp) is crucial as it provides information about the nature of chest discomfort, a common symptom of heart conditions. Types include typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, and asymptomatic.
Resting blood pressure (trestbps) measures the force of blood against artery walls during rest, with high values being an indicator of cardiovascular stress.
Serum cholesterol (chol) levels indicate fat levels in the blood, which can contribute to plaque formation in arteries.
Fasting blood sugar (fbs) above 120 mg/dl is flagged as high, linking diabetes as a risk factor for heart disease.
Resting electrocardiographic results (restecg) highlight electrical activity abnormalities in the heart that may signal disease.
Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach) reflects cardiovascular fitness and performance, where lower-than-expected rates may suggest issues.
Exercise-induced angina (exang) indicates whether chest pain is triggered by exercise, often correlating with reduced blood flow to the heart.
Oldpeak measures ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, helping to assess ischemic changes.
Slope of the ST segment (slope) reflects the exercise response, with different patterns associated with varying risks of coronary artery disease.
Number of major vessels (ca) colored by fluoroscopy provides insight into blood flow blockages in the heart's main vessels.
Thalassemia (thal) categorizes a blood disorder that can affect oxygen-carrying capacity, with abnormal values being a red flag.
Target is the outcome variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.
