### Abstract: 
Heart disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with modern lifestyles significantly contributing to its prevalence. Accurate identification of heart disease is a critical yet complex task that requires precision and expertise. However, not all healthcare providers have access to specialists or advanced diagnostic tools. An automated system for heart disease prediction can enhance healthcare quality, increase accessibility, and reduce costs.
In this project, we have developed a machine learning-based system to efficiently predict heart disease risk levels based on health parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and age. The system uses advanced algorithms to discover predictive patterns and generate interpretable rules that can be customized to prioritize based on user needs. The model's performance has been evaluated through metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, demonstrating its potential for accurate and reliable heart disease prediction.
This project emphasizes the integration of technology in healthcare to improve diagnostic accuracy and enable timely interventions, especially in areas with limited access to specialists.
